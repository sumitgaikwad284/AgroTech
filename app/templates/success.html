                    <p class="card-text"> In 2014, Sachin Kale established Innovative Agrilife Solutions Pvt. Ltd that supported farmers through a farming model based on contract. Furthermore, witnessing the fact that paddy fields are used only for around 3 to 4 months after which they are left unused, another idea struck his mind. Sachin Kale suggested the farmers to use the land during that period to grow seasonal vegetables</p>
